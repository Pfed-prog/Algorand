# Algorand-ML-Broker

The application would also access data to assist users in issuing standard and more exotic financial instruments.

Indexer data to assess the credibility of the issuer. Smart contracts to decentralize and eliminate the broker. I am also interested in implementing a contract akin to collateralized debt that would use Nfts as collateral. Would also use ML to estimate the value the NFT.

Algogrand Data can assist in verifying the history of transactions.
The broker is usually the agent that verifies the data.
Instead of the broker in this instance there is an automatic system that takes the inputs and decides whether seller can be trusted or not.
